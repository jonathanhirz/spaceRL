Space roguelike for mobile. Made with luxe engine

[ ] fly around and shoot stuff
[ ] shooting will be automatic, based on weapon upgrades and firerate
[ ] you can specify an enemy/asteroid you want to target by tapping on it
[ ] when enemies/asteroids explode, 'bits' spawn and you get the satisfying *bling bling* collection action
[ ] return to space station to heal/upgrade. this may also respawn area enemies (dark souls like)
[ ] circular radar shows location of space stations
[ ] harder enemies carry locations for new space stations
[ ] continue to new areas to beat harder enemies, more 'bits' better weapons, etc

[ ] drop/start location is a larger ship/carrier. this sets the origin (0,0) for (x,y) coordinates (shown on screen)
